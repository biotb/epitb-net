# An epistatic network describes *oppA* and *glgB* as relevant genes for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
## Abstract
*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is an acid-fast bacteria that causes tuberculosis disease worldwide. The role of epistatic interactions among different sites of the *M. tuberculosis* genome under selection by selective pressure may be crucial for understanding the disease and the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance acquisition. Here, we analyzed polymorphic loci interactions applying a model-free method for epistasis detection, SpydrPick, on a pan-genome-wide alignment created from a set of 254 complete reference genomes available to date. By means of the analysis of an epistatic network created with the detected epistatic interactions, we found that *glgB* ($\alpha$-1,4-glucan branching enzyme) and *oppA* (oligopeptide-binding protein) are putative targets of co-selection in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* since they were associated in the network with Tuberculosis genes related to virulence, pathogenesis, transport systems modulators of the immune response, and antibiotic resistance. In addition, our work unveiled potential pharmacological applications for genotypic antibiotic resistance inherent to mutations of *glgB* and *oppA*, as they epistatically interact with *fprA* and *embC*, two genes recently included as antibiotic-resistant genes in the catalogue of the World Health Organization. Our findings showed that this approach allows the identification of relevant epistatic interactions that may lead to a better understanding of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and that may be applied to different bacterial populations.
